Insanity Platform Abstraction Framework for C++

What's this? Another API for building applications on multiple platforms? You bet your butt it is.

Insanity is the finally stable iteration of just such a project. Designed on and for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (primary development done with Ubuntu), it delivers a simple, COM-like setup with abstractions for networking, threading, windowing, and even module development.
